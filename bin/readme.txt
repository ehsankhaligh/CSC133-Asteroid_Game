Assignment 2:

kill Asteroid with a Missile 'k'
crash ship into Asteroid 'c'
two asteroids have collided with and exterminated each other 'x'
Tick 't'
load missile 'o'
map 'm'

Assigname 3:

1)


2) set fuel level to 100 because time moves faster.
3) Added extra sound for asteroid collision. 
4) Because the timer is fast. For seeing the collsions please wait 3-4 second after begining of the program and then add the objects.  This gives enough time for GUI to load. 
If we dont give enough time, program is not able to complte the operation.  It needs enough time, otherwise it throws a exception. 
5) in Some extrme case program may show indexing or null pointer execpetion. If you get that just click on ok and continue game without any effect on the game. 
6) set timer to 100ms that program has engought time to do the operation inclusing iterators and printStatements. If we use really small number prohram  will not have enough 
time to handel all operations.
